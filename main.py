##! TESTING THE FNN CLASS

##TODO TASK 2



##TODO TASK 3
##* Implement the stochastic gradient method (SGD) to train the network. The im-
##* plementation of the SGD should allow for different mini-batch sizes and different
##* numbers of epochs. An epoch is the complete pass of the training data through
##* the learning algorithm.




##TODO TASK 4
##* Implement the backpropagation algorithm (used in SGD to effectively calculate
##* the derivative).




##TODO TASK 5
##* Train and test the accuracy of the network for the following parameters:
##* • Input layer with 784 + 1 neurons
##* • hidden layer with 30 + 1 neurons
##* • Output layer with 10 neurons
##* As loss function use the quadratic function (square loss)
##* 1/2n ∑_x ||h_w(x) - y||_2 ^2
##* where (x, y) is a pair of training data, n the amount of used training data, and hw
##* represents the neural network.




##TODO TASK 6
##* Print an output of the learning success per epoch.




##TODO TASK 7
##* Implement an attack on the trained neural network.
